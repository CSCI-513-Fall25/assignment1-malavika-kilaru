The Strategy Design pattern is ideal for this Battleship search problem because it encapsulates different search algorithms into interchangeable strategy objects, allowing the system to dynamically switch between search methods without modifying the core search logic. Each strategy(HorizontalSweep, RandomSearch,StrategicSearch) implements the same SearchStrategy interface, enabling polymorphism and maintaining loose coupling between the search controller and specific algorithms. This design provides significant advantages:new search strategies can be easily added without changing existing code(Open/Closed principle), each algorithm is self-contained and testable, and the performance of different approaches can be objectively compared. The pattern also allows for runtime strategy selection and makes the code more maintainable by separating concerns- the BattleshipSearch class handles game management while strategy classes focus solely on their search logic.
